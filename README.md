**THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER UPDATED AND SUPPORTED. PLEASE USE [PhyloProfile](https://github.com/BIONF/phyloprofile_oneseq) instead.**

PhyloProfile is a Shiny(R)-based tool for integrating, visualizing and exploring multi- layered phylogenetic profiles

Alongside the presence/absence pattern of orthologs across large taxon collections, PhyloProfile allows the integration of any two additional information layers. These complementary data, e.g. sequence similarity between orthologs, similarities and differences of their domain architectures or their Gene Ontology-term-based semantic similarities, etc. will enable a more reliable functional inference among those orthologous sequences.

By utilizing the NCBI taxonomy, input taxa can be dynamically collapsed into higher order systematic groups. By that you can rapidly change the resolution from the comparative analyses of proteins in individual species to that of entire kingdoms or even domains without the need of input data modification.

Profiles can be filtered dynamically according to various criteria. For example, setting a minimal threshold for the fraction of species in a systematic group, or filtering collections of orthologs based on the pre-computed similarity of their domain architectures - if provided as an information layer.
